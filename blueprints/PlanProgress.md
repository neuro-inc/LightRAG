# Apolo-Copilot Implementation Progress

Based on the original plan in [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md), this document tracks our implementation progress.

## Project Overview
**Goal:** Create an intelligent assistant that leverages LightRAG for information retrieval, incorporating recursive querying, a context-accumulating reducer, hierarchical indexing, and rich entity/metadata definitions, all integrated within a LangGraph framework.

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 0: Foundation & Setup ⏳ IN PROGRESS

#### Technology Stack Finalization ✅ COMPLETED
- **LightRAG:** Using current deployment (v1.3.7) with docker-compose.minimal.yml
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (configured in existing .env)
- **Embedding Model:** OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (configured in existing .env)
- **Graph Database:** NetworkX (file-based, from minimal stack)
- **Vector Database:** PostgreSQL + pgvector (from minimal stack)
- **Orchestration Framework:** **LangGraph** (to be implemented)
- **Development Environment:** Python with existing setup

#### Data Source Identification & Preparation ⏳ IN PROGRESS
- ✅ **Local Docs:** Using `./apolo-documentation` folder as source
- ❌ **Documentation URLs:** To be implemented (crawling strategy)

#### Initial Schema Design (Entities & Relations) ⏳ IN PROGRESS
- **Core Entities:** Designing for Apolo platform documentation
  - ✅ DocumentChunk: Basic unit of text from documentation
  - ✅ DocumentationPage: Apolo documentation pages  
  - ❌ CodeSnippet: Apolo CLI commands and code examples
  - ❌ CLICommand: Apolo CLI command documentation
  - ❌ Topic/Concept: Key Apolo concepts (jobs, storage, etc.)

#### Environment Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ LightRAG deployed with docker-compose.minimal.yml
- ✅ Python environment with required dependencies
- ✅ .env configured with API keys

### Phase 1: Core LightRAG Implementation & Initial Indexing ✅ COMPLETED

#### Data Ingestion & Preprocessing ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Local File Loader for apolo-documentation
- ✅ Chunking Strategy implementation (using LightRAG defaults)
- ✅ Metadata extraction (title, section, audience, content type)

#### LightRAG Configuration ✅ COMPLETED  
- ✅ LightRAG instance running with minimal stack
- ✅ Custom entity/relation schema designed for Apolo platform

#### Initial Indexing Pipeline ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Load apolo-documentation into LightRAG (86 documents loaded successfully)
- ✅ Entity/Relation extraction working with default LightRAG prompts
- ✅ Hierarchical graph construction (documentation structure preserved)
- ✅ Metadata population (path, section, audience, CLI commands)

### Phase 2: Implementing Recursive Retrieval & Reducer Logic ❌ NOT STARTED

### Phase 3: Assistant Integration with LangGraph ❌ NOT STARTED

### Phase 4: Evaluation, Optimization & Iteration ❌ NOT STARTED

### Phase 5: Deployment & Maintenance ❌ NOT STARTED

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Complete, Moving to Phase 2

### Recently Completed
- [x] Technology stack decisions finalized
- [x] LightRAG deployed with minimal Docker stack
- [x] Environment configured with API keys
- [x] Project structure setup for apolo-copilot
- [x] Documentation analysis and schema design
- [x] Data loader implementation
- [x] Successfully loaded 86 Apolo documentation files
- [x] Basic query testing working
- [x] CLI interface implemented and tested
- [x] Phase 1 objectives completed

### Currently Working On
- [ ] LangGraph recursive retrieval implementation (Phase 2)
- [ ] Context accumulation and reduction logic
- [ ] LLM evaluation nodes for completeness assessment

### Next Steps
1. Create simple CLI interface for user interaction
2. Implement LangGraph workflow for recursive retrieval
3. Add LLM evaluation and context reduction
4. Test recursive querying capabilities
5. Optimize and refine the system

### Implementation Notes

#### Technology Decisions Made
- Using existing LightRAG minimal stack (NetworkX + PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- Focusing on Apolo platform documentation as primary data source
- LangGraph chosen for orchestration framework
- File-based approach for initial development (can scale later)

```

### Risks and Mitigation
1. **Risk:** Apolo documentation may not be well-structured for entity extraction
   **Mitigation:** Start with manual analysis, then adapt schema based on actual content

2. **Risk:** LangGraph learning curve may slow initial development
   **Mitigation:** Start with simple linear flow, then add complexity iteratively

### Success Metrics for Phase 0
- [x] LightRAG successfully deployed and accessible
- [ ] Apolo-copilot project structure created
- [ ] Initial documentation loaded into LightRAG
- [ ] Basic retrieval working with Apolo content
- [ ] Schema design documented and validated
